To install Perl modules:

first run

> cpan App::cpanminus

to get an improved module downloader cpanm, then to install a module like MediaWiki::API write

> cpanm MediaWiki::API 

Encountering an error: 'dmake' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.  This is because ActiveState Perl does not support dmake.  Switching to StrawberryPerl instead.
